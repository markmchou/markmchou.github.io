My name is Mark Chou and I was born and raised in San Francisco, CA. I am going into my third year at UH Manoa majoring in Finance and MIS. I decided to to pursue this major because I feel that IS and technology is apart of many different careers and almost all areas of life nowadays. I hope this class can make me more interested in coding/programming and help me figure out what I want to do with my life.
