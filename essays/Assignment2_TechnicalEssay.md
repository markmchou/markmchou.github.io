Assignment 2 is an upgrade of what we did in assignment 1. We added a login page and registration page where users can join our website if they want to make a purchase. Just like how assignment 1 checked if the quantity data was valid, assignment 2 checked if the user's name, username, email, and password were in the correct guidelines. When a user registers for the website, the data gets saved in an array so the site can remember the information if the user needs to log in.

<br>From this assignment, I learned that you have to comment on all of your code. This assignment had many pages and files, I got lost and unorganized. I realized that I needed to put comments on things to understand what they were and where things were. I also learned to google a lot of the code that I was struggling with. There are many great resources out there and it saves time from asking Professor Port or a classmate. And of course, furthering my knowledge in coding and improving/building upon my skills. 

<br>Partner Contribution: Me -  50% | Faye Miguel - 50% 
<br>Faye and I sat down, side by side to work on the code. We worked on the assignment together every time, nobody worked alone. We collaborated on what we wanted to do and how to design the website. It helped a lot because I was able to see things and do different codes with a new perspective. I have trouble with designing, so Faye helps a lot in making me more creative with that. 

<br> When my partner and I needed help with something, we would start researching on the internet or ask other classmates. 

<br>Developing this assignment was very different from assignment 1 because it was more complicated and had more advanced code. I feel like everything we did throughout the semester helped with assignment 1 but we only got to learn how to do the login and registration in such a short time. It was very difficult and made assignment 1 look easier than we thought. 

<br> 40% of the time was spent thinking about how to do something and 60% of the time was spent writing the code

<br> What worked well: Working with a partner worked well because it cut the work in half and we were able to be more creative with the code and design. 
<br> What did not work well: Throughout the project, we had a lot of stupid mistakes that would get us frustrated. They were hard to find because there were many files and lots of code. We need to be more detail-oriented and catch those mistakes, or at least use console to find where the error is in the file. 

<br> If I could go back and do things differently, I would spend more time commenting on my code. I would have saved more time if I knew where things were and what things were. Once I added comments, it made the process of creating assignment 2 a lot smoother and faster.
