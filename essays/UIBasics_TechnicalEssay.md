  I thought I had a pretty good idea of how to do BrowserHistory1 so I started it without reading all of the instructions. I ended up being stuck on a lot of the steps. I googled how to do each of them instead of watching the screencast. I found a lot of great resources (including w3schools which is part of the reading) that showed me what codes I needed to complete the WODs. I ended up not finishing BrowserHistory1 within the DNF time for my first try. I deleted all of the files and restarted. Before starting my timer, I made sure to read all of the instructions. I was able to finish BrowserHistory1 in about 23 minutes. I then watched the screencast to make sure everything was correct. 
  My advice is to read all of the instructions before you start to work on the WOD. I also recommend googling/searching up what you do not know because you can get the code you need and an explanation for it. I did this for the next two WODs and was able to finish both within the DNF time. Also, make sure you do all of the required readings.
