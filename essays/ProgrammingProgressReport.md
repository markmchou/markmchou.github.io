"My programming skills have greatly improved." I agree with this statement. Even though I do not think I am great at programming, I have never done it before this class and have learned a lot. Commenting on the code for assignment 1 helped me understand what each line of code was doing and it helped me figure out if anything was missing to make my site function. 
<br> 
"I am enthusiastic about programming." I disagree with this statement because these assignments are coming in at the end of the semester. All my other classes are also having projects/essays/assignments so it is hard to find time to enjoy programming. I will probably be rushing most of these assignments. 
<br>
"I can do the practice WODs without looking at the screencast solutions." I agree with this statement. The screencast solutions help me finish the WODs quickly and only in one try, but without them I am still able to finish. It may take me two tries and finish in standard time, but I still learn from it and gain new skills.
<br>
"The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence." I agree with this statement. Coming from a background of no coding, the labs have given me a foundation of knowledge for javascript, html, css, etc. I feel that they can be a little bit more challenging to better prepare us for the assignments but overall, they are still helpful. 
<br>
"I feel ready to move to the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications)." I kind of agree with this statement. I was not ready for assignment 1 but being forced to do the assignment on time helped me learn all the different parts to the assignment. Even if I am not ready for assignment 2, I know I will be able to get it done if I put in the time, work, and effort.
<br>
"I think the class can be improved to help my learning." I feel that the assignments are little rushed at the end of the semester. The class could have picked up the pace a little bit when we were only doing labs so we would have more time to focus on the assignments. I also feel that I learn more from the assignments than any other thing we do in class. 
<br>
"There are things that work really well my learning in this class." I like the WODs we do for class. Although I prefer to do it with screencast solutions available, working on the WOD at home and trying to finish in a timely manner helped me gain skills and knowledge that prepared me for the labs and assignments. They also do not take up too much time.
