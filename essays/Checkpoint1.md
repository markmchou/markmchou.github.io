<br>1. Describe the web-application you intend to build (in detail please!)
<br>Website for the American Marketing Association that will let members sign-up for the organization, pay their dues, see the overview about AMA, look at the current executive officers, the login page to see the newsletter, gallery for the events, and a page where they can shop for AMA merchandise.

<br>Indicate how you expect the application will make use of the required technical complexity items (e.g. file I/O, sessions, multi-dimensional arrays, etc.)
<br>CSS to make the website professional to match the organization’s brand theme and aesthetic. Form Processing for members to sign up for AMA membership. Data Validation for member registration and ensure members entered valid data on buying merchandise. Multi-dimensional arrays for the products on the merchandise page, members, and types of memberships

<br>What is your plan to ensure you successfully complete your project before the end of the semester?
<br>We will create a plan of what progress should be done on each day that we work together. Setting goals will help organize and sort out what we need to do. We will allocate two hours each day to work on the project to make sure that we do not cram it all during finals week. 

<br>What progress have you made so far and what is left for you to do?
<br>As of now, we have all the content that’s going to be inside the website, an empty template of how the whole site is going to look like, and the index.html that contains the organization’s basic information. We have to do the rest of the other pages and add CSS codes to make it look nicer.
